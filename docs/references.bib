  abstract  = "The Cox model is a regression technique for performing survival
               analyses in epidemiological and clinical research. This model
               estimates the hazard ratio (HR) of a given endpoint associated
               with a specific risk factor, which can be either a continuous
               variable like age and C-reactive protein level or a categorical
               variable like gender and diabetes mellitus. When the risk factor
               is a continuous variable, the Cox model provides the HR of the
               study endpoint associated with a predefined unit of increase in
               the independent variable (e.g., for every 1-year increase in
               age, 2 mg/L increase in C-reactive protein). A fundamental
               assumption underlying the application of the Cox model is
               proportional hazards; in other words, the effects of different
               variables on survival are constant over time and additive over a
               particular scale. The Cox regression model, when applied to
               etiological studies, also allows an adjustment for potential
               confounders; in an exposure-outcome pathway, a confounder is a
               variable which is associated with the exposure, is not an effect
               of the exposure, does not lie in the causal pathway between the
               exposure and the outcome, and represents a risk factor for the
               outcome.",

@ARTICLE{Walters2012,
  title     = "Analyzing time to event outcomes with a Cox regression model",
  author    = "Walters, Stephen J",
  abstract  = "AbstractSurvival analysis is concerned with studying the time
               between entry to a study and a subsequent event (such as death).
               Survival times now often refer to the development of a
               particular symptom or to relapse after remission of a disease,
               as well as to the time to death. A Cox regression model is a
               statistical technique for exploring the relationship between the
               survival of a patient and several explanatory variables. A Cox
               regression model provides an estimate of the treatment effect on
               survival after adjustment for other explanatory variables. Also,
               it allows us to estimate the hazard or risk of death for an
               individual given their prognostic variables. A Cox regression
               model must be fitted using an appropriate computer program (such
               as R, S‐Plus, SAS, STATA, or SPSS). The final model from a Cox
               regression analysis yields an equation for the hazard as a
               function of several explanatory variables. Interpreting the Cox
               regression model involves examining the coefficients for each
               explanatory variable. A positive regression coefficient sign for
               an explanatory variable means that the hazard is higher and thus
               the prognosis worse. Conversely, a negative regression
               coefficient implies a worse prognosis for patients with higher
               values of that variable. WIREs Comput Stat 2012, 4:310--315.
