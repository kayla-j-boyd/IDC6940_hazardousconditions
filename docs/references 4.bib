  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Cox model relies on the proportional hazards
               (PH) assumption, implying that the factors investigated have a
               constant impact on the hazard - or risk - over time. We
               emphasize the importance of this assumption and the misleading
               conclusions that can be inferred if it is violated; this is
               particularly essential in the presence of long follow-ups.
               METHODS: We illustrate our discussion by analyzing prognostic
               factors of metastases in 979 women treated for breast cancer
               with surgery. Age, tumour size and grade, lymph node
               involvement, peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI), status of
               hormone receptors (HRec), Her2, and Mib1 were considered.
               RESULTS: Median follow-up was 14 years; 264 women developed
               metastases. The conventional Cox model suggested that all
               factors but HRec, Her2, and Mib1 status were strong prognostic
               factors of metastases. Additional tests indicated that the PH
               assumption was not satisfied for some variables of the model.
               Tumour grade had a significant time-varying effect, but although
               its effect diminished over time, it remained strong.
               Interestingly, while the conventional Cox model did not show any
               significant effect of the HRec status, tests provided strong
               evidence that this variable had a non-constant effect over time.
               Negative HRec status increased the risk of metastases early but
               became protective thereafter. This reversal of effect may
               explain non-significant hazard ratios provided by previous
               conventional Cox analyses in studies with long follow-ups.
               CONCLUSIONS: Investigating time-varying effects should be an
               integral part of Cox survival analyses. Detecting and accounting
               for time-varying effects provide insights on some specific time

               variable like age and C-reactive protein level or a categorical
               variable like gender and diabetes mellitus. When the risk factor
               is a continuous variable, the Cox model provides the HR of the
               study endpoint associated with a predefined unit of increase in
               the independent variable (e.g., for every 1-year increase in

  abstract  = "AbstractSurvival analysis is concerned with studying the time
               between entry to a study and a subsequent event (such as death).
               Survival times now often refer to the development of a
               particular symptom or to relapse after remission of a disease,
               as well as to the time to death. A Cox regression model is a
               statistical technique for exploring the relationship between the
               survival of a patient and several explanatory variables. A Cox
               regression model provides an estimate of the treatment effect on
               survival after adjustment for other explanatory variables. Also,
               it allows us to estimate the hazard or risk of death for an
               individual given their prognostic variables. A Cox regression
               model must be fitted using an appropriate computer program (such
               as R, S‐Plus, SAS, STATA, or SPSS). The final model from a Cox
               regression analysis yields an equation for the hazard as a
               function of several explanatory variables. Interpreting the Cox
               regression model involves examining the coefficients for each
               explanatory variable. A positive regression coefficient sign for
               an explanatory variable means that the hazard is higher and thus
               the prognosis worse. Conversely, a negative regression
               coefficient implies a worse prognosis for patients with higher
               values of that variable. WIREs Comput Stat 2012, 4:310--315.
